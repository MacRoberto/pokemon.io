          <h3>What is this?</h3>
          <p>
            <br />This website provides a RESTful API interface to highly
            detailed objects built <br />from thousands of lines of data related
            to Pokémon. We specifically cover <br />the video game franchise.
            Using this website, you can consume information <br />on Pokémon,
            their moves, abilities, types, egg groups and much, much more.

          <h3>What is an API?</h3>
          <p>
            <br />An API (Application Programming Interface) is a contract that
            allow <br />developers to interact with an application through a set
            of interfaces. <br />In this case, the application is a database of
            thousands of Pokémon-related <br />objects, and the interfaces are
            URL links. <br />A RESTful API is an API that conforms to a set of
            loose conventions based on <br />HTTP verbs, errors, and hyperlinks.
